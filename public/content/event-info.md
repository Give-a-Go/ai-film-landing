# AI Filmmaking Hackathon


A two-day cinematic experiment at the intersection of film, AI, and creative technology.

This isn’t a demo day. It’s not a conference. And it’s definitely not just another hackathon.

We’re bringing together exceptional filmmakers, creatives, and technologists to create short films designed for the big screen, built under real constraints and finished in an intense, high-production environment.

The event culminates in a public cinema screening — a proper cultural moment celebrating what happens when storytelling, craft, and frontier AI tools collide.

## The Vision

To prove that AI-powered filmmaking can be cinematic, intentional, and emotionally compelling.

We’re focused on finished films, not experiments. Work that holds up in a dark room, on a large screen, with an audience watching together.

By combining experienced creative talent with cutting-edge AI workflows, we’re creating space for new kinds of stories to emerge — stories that couldn’t exist any other way.

## What to Expect

Two days. One intense creative sprint. A cinema audience.

**A curated group** of filmmakers, creatives, and builders working side-by-side.

**Hands-on access** to frontier AI video, image, and audio models throughout the build.

**Hybrid production**: real-world capture combined with AI-driven visuals, sound, and post.

**Practical, modern workflows** focused on actually finishing work.

**Mentorship** from experienced film and post-production professionals.

**A public screening night** that feels like a real premiere, not a tech showcase.

## The Outcome

Short films that feel **thoughtful**, **cinematic**, and **finished**.

Films that hold an audience and spark conversation.

## Why This Matters

Ireland has world-class creative talent and a fast-growing AI community, but they rarely get to build together in the same room, under the same creative pressure.

This event is about closing that gap and creating a moment where art and technology meet at a serious creative level.

When experienced filmmakers, agency creatives, and technologists collaborate under an insane timeline, something special happens. Ideas sharpen. Stories move faster. Boundaries get pushed.

## Stay Close

More details will be shared soon. Participant applications and screening tickets will be limited.

If you care about the future of filmmaking — and want to see what’s possible when creative ambition meets modern AI — this is one to watch.
